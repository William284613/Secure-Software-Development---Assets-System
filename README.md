This project focuses on enhancing the security and integrity of an asset management system. Below are the key areas addressed:

1. Data Integrity and Confidentiality: Implemented mechanisms to ensure data integrity through authorized edits and secure upload processes.
   All changes are recorded to maintain an accurate audit trail.

2. Access Control: Enforced robust role-based access controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
   Strong authentication measures, including multi-factor authentication, are implemented to secure user access.

3. Input Validation and Secure Coding: Adopted secure coding practices and thorough input validation to prevent data tampering and unauthorized manipulation of asset registration data.

4. Brute-force Attack Prevention: Implemented monitoring tools to track login attempts and notify users of account lockout statuses to mitigate brute-force attack risks.

5. Document Verification: Established a document verification process that cross-references submitted information with official databases to prevent false information during onboarding.

6. Exception Handling: Developed a robust exception handling framework across various functionalities to ensure graceful error management and user notifications.

7. User Experience Enhancements: Improved user experience by providing clear notifications and alerts for various system statuses, such as login attempts and error messages.
